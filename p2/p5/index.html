  <p>i don't like this. it's not awful but i wouldn't drink it again. "citrus" is so vague and it doesn't even taste that citrus-y. the white one tasted more citrus-y. this is just kinda gross in an overly sweet way. like watered down gatorade</p>

  <p>maybe 5-hour energies just aren’t for me because when i, as someone who’s had many terrible tasting drinks, says this smells like a poison that i’m vaguely terrified of, i feel like it matters just a lil bit. perhaps it’s just because all the flavor is condensed into a tiny bottle but yeah this isn’t for me. it’s tropical but too much. everything about it is too much. to poisonous, too sweet, too tangy, too strong. no. no.  </p>

  <p>flavor wise i think this is awful: very vitamin water/cough syrup-y, way too artificial/flavorful for something that's supposed to be watermelon, but the part i actually hate is the fact that it's marketed to look healthy even though it's not. yes, it's vegan/vegetarian + has no sugar but just because something doesn't have sugar doesn't mean it's healthy like this has 110% dv of most vitamins in it so </p>

  <p>incredibly fizzy, very mild flavor, no smell at all: reminds me a lot of hi-ball. the nutrition label doesn't mention vitamin b12 at all, and i can't find anything about this brand on the internet, so i can't tell if this would be "healthier" than hi-ball, but, in terms of price, hi-ball would be better because there's more for the same price </p>

  <p>really sweet, not amazing, and also not super memorable, and it was disgusting. in addition to that bang is problematic as heck. like. genuinely scarily problematic. ignoring all the political aspects and whatnot (which is not something i'd typically say which really goes to show how problematic bang is), they act as though this "super creatine" is something that is unique to them, and, while it's true that there have been studies done on how creatine is beneficial (primarily in terms of power output), “super creatine” isn’t actually enough creatine to have any effect. also you’d have to take a certain amount daily for it to have an effect and for you muscles to be saturated enough to even Appear to have an effect. so. um. yeah. even going further and ignoring how misleading that is: the amount of creatine that's recommended as a supplement is 3-5g. the amount of super creatine in bang energy is estimated to be around 25mg. so. again. uhhhhhh. but yuh that is just the tip of the iceberg of bold scientific claims </p>

  <p>okay literally all the can designs are super ugly and the flavors are wack but they’re not bad i guess? thus far they’re all just eh. also i’ve never actually bought a bang i’ve just tried it from over people and i will never pay for this myself. it reminds me of bubbline though which i like</p>

  <p>okay first off if i wasn't suicidal i'd probably be afraid of bang because what the fuck is up with that shit but uhhhh this is so sweet. like it's fake sugar that mostly consists of sugar alcohol but why is it so fucking sweet it makes me want to try the sour heads flavor. it really does taste like purple but not in the same way that the monster ultra violet tastes like purple. that purple is more tangy and mild and then this purple is like grape nerds liquified and shot up with cocaine purple</p>

  <p>it's like bubblegum flavored cough syrup or smarties which is fine but the part i find issue with is the fact that the nutrition label makes it appear as though it's healthy even though it's clearly marketed in a way that demonstrates it's not, in such a way that it's supposed to attract young people (name of flavors, flavor itself, bright colors, etc), but has so many sus ingredients and all the info i've read about them is sus: why are they telling me i shouldn’t drink it because i have a medical condition and take prescription medicine? why do they use artificial sweeteners that ruin the fizzy? </p>

  <p>this reminds of me of bougie natural cough drops, obviously the honey ones, but also the fact that there’s ginseng in it is unsurprising because it definitely has that taste. i wouldn’t say it’s bad, but it’s weird for sure. unique if anything, and i’m still on the fence about it despite having drank the whole can. </p>

  <p>i was about to say this is my favorite of the celsius’s so far but idk the green tea aftertaste just isn’t my favorite. like that tea texture that makes your mouth feel kinda like grainy and thick? yeah it’s there. it’s not super strong and the peach mango flavor mellows it out but i’m not like amazed with this. i would drink it again though. also i kinda like that none of these have been like super super sweet or have a shit ton of sugar (*cough* red bull with their wack ass fucking like 38 grams of sugar which is only slightly less than the average amount of sugar someone is supposed to consume in a DAY in a single can *cough*)</p>

  <p>upon first taste it’s pretty awful but it’s actually not that bad. like it’s sweeter than i was expecting but in like a tangy way. kinda tastes like cough medicine but weirdly it’s not bad. if this is how healthy energy drinks taste i might as well convert. but i am also okay with dying and if monsters are how i die then that’s just how it be 😌</p>

  <p>this gets a higher rating because it's healthy but idk its literally just okay. like it's not bad but it's not good. sarah says it tastes like the exact way drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth feels but that doesn't make any sense to me. anyways. it's not bad. especially given the fact that the smoothie i’m drinking with it tastes like fancy dirt. does not remind me of kiwi or guava though</p>

  <p>brand: celsius </p>
  <p>i think this only gets such a good rating compared to the other celcius's because it doesn't taste like garbage. celsius is overhyped in a myriad of ways but the top one is easily the fact that it is also marketed as ""healthy"" but then, when you actually look at the nutritional label, there's a lot of issues. none of the vitamins should be that high, and the biotin definitely shouldn't be 1000%, which is a major problem among basically all energy drinks that are marketed for 0/low calorie. </p>
