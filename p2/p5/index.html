  <h1>Monster Hunt </h1>
  <div class="intro" style="font-weight: lighter;">
  <p>health is a commodity. of course there are also environmental impacts, and by environmental impacts i'm also referring to racial impacts that lead to environmental impacts in terms of lack of access, and, yes, health should be public, but honestly i didn't notice the distinct lack of healthy energy drinks before. i assumed that it was common because those that were branded that way were also sold at target, but target is technically also a grocery store, and there are areas without any grocery stores (i.e. environmental racism). and convenience stores and gas stations and liquor stores only really have unhealthy energy drinks. unhealthy meaning almost every ingredient is synthetic, which, while isn't inherently a bad thing, they also contain an excess of sugar. many with nearly the daily allowance of sugar per serving or more. which, again, isn't inherently a bad thing, but an overabundance of such on a regular basis? yikes. a melding pot of problems suddenly arises. but, in addition to that, i've realized that there really is no such thing as a "healthy" energy drink. every energy drink i have ever seen or tried has had an excess of something in it. celsius is probably the most popular energy drink that's marketed as healthy, and it has 1000% of the DV of biotin, which then connects to the ploys of multi-level marketing. health is a commodity when it should be public. </p></div>
 <div class="intro" style="font-weight: lighter;">
<p>likewise, “capitalism breeds innovation” but that sentiment is why red bull is so easily the highest grossing energy drink: their primary competitors (monster and rockstar) have nothing on them. their originals aren’t original. and that’s only the beginning of where they fail. in addition to that, red bull is the only privately owned energy drink company. monster partnered with coca-cola in 2014, is based in california, and owns reign, burn, nos, and predator. rockstar was sold to pepsico in 2020 (who also owns pepsi (obviously), gatorade, and tropicana), and originated in san francisco, but pepsico made a deal with vitalpharmacuticals (the owner of bang) in 2020. venom is owned by the dr pepper snapple group. in short: capitalism is complicated, but also a scam.</p> </div>

  <p>maybe 5-hour energies just aren’t for me because when i, as someone who’s had many terrible tasting drinks, says this smells like a poison that i’m vaguely terrified of, i feel like it matters just a lil bit. perhaps it’s just because all the flavor is condensed into a tiny bottle but yeah this isn’t for me. it’s tropical but too much. everything about it is too much. to poisonous, too sweet, too tangy, too strong. no. no.  </p>

  <p>flavor wise i think this is awful: very vitamin water/cough syrup-y, way too artificial/flavorful for something that's supposed to be watermelon, but the part i actually hate is the fact that it's marketed to look healthy even though it's not. yes, it's vegan/vegetarian + has no sugar but just because something doesn't have sugar doesn't mean it's healthy like this has 110% dv of most vitamins in it so. </p>

  <p>incredibly fizzy, very mild flavor, no smell at all: reminds me a lot of hi-ball. the nutrition label doesn't mention vitamin b12 at all, and i can't find anything about this brand on the internet, so i can't tell if this would be "healthier" than hi-ball, but, in terms of price, hi-ball would be better because there's more for the same price. </p>

  <p>really sweet, not amazing, and also not super memorable, and it was disgusting. in addition to that bang is problematic as heck. like. genuinely scarily problematic. ignoring all the political aspects and whatnot (which is not something i'd typically say which really goes to show how problematic bang is), they act as though this "super creatine" is something that is unique to them, and, while it's true that there have been studies done on how creatine is beneficial (primarily in terms of power output), “super creatine” isn’t actually enough creatine to have any effect. also you’d have to take a certain amount daily for it to have an effect and for you muscles to be saturated enough to even Appear to have an effect. so. um. yeah. even going further and ignoring how misleading that is: the amount of creatine that's recommended as a supplement is 3-5g. the amount of super creatine in bang energy is estimated to be around 25mg. so. again. uhhhhhh. but yuh that is just the tip of the iceberg of bold scientific claims. </p>

  <p>it's like bubblegum flavored cough syrup or smarties which is fine but the part i find issue with is the fact that the nutrition label makes it appear as though it's healthy even though it's clearly marketed in a way that demonstrates it's not, in such a way that it's supposed to attract young people (name of flavors, flavor itself, bright colors, etc), but has so many sus ingredients and all the info i've read about them is sus: why are they telling me i shouldn’t drink it because i have a medical condition and take prescription medicine? why do they use artificial sweeteners that ruin the fizzy? </p>

  <p>i think i hated yerba mate a lot more before or this flavor makes the yerba mate flavor a lot more mild but this isn't bad. i wish it was more fizzy, but the earthiness and texture that yerba mate usually has isn't as prominent which i appreciate. typically i hate cherry flavored drinks, but that nor the lime isn't really present either. overall, this is basically really mild. if i was basing this on matching the taste and smell with the flavor, i'd say this is maybe a generous 1/10. in terms of my personal preference, this is easily the best yerba mate i've ever had.

  <h3>raspberry</h3>
  <p>brand: clean </p>
  <p> this is tied but maybe even very slightly better than the blackberry. it barely tastes like yerba mate but also doesn’t really taste like raspberry either. i’d drink it again but i wouldn’t buy it again.</p>

  <h3>watermelon mint</h3>
  <p>brand: clean </p>
  <p> i hate this: i think the mint makes the yerba mate flavor much stronger and no. no. watermelon is such a mild tasting thing that it does nothing to eliminate that. no thank you. </p>

  <p> this tastes absolutely nothing like caramel. it goes down more smoothly than the zero-sugar vanilla one, but that's likely just the sheer amount of sugar. i still hate coffee and coke. </p>

  <p> well. this is certainly a drink that was made. there's not really much to comment on this because i hate coke and it sure does taste like coke. however, it didn't scan properly at target in self-checkout so the dude working just put in that it was $1.00 even though it's definitely more so yuh a steal, and for that alone it almost deserves a point. but still no. </p>
