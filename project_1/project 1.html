      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>According to the US’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 4.2 million Americans have a visual impairment. Vision disabilities are expected to rise around the world in part because of population growth and ageing, according to WHO.

<p>When New York-based design studio Applied Design rebranded the Braille Institute of America (BIA), its design team struggled to find a typeface that was both “extremely legible” and stylistically appropriate for the organisation’s new look.<p>

<p>In response to this, and aware of the growing number of visually impaired people around the world, the studio developed its own typeface for the project, Atkinson Hyperlegible.<p>

<p>Since adopting the typeface, the BIA has made Atkinson Hyperlegible free for everyone. Most recently, it has landed on Google Fonts.<p>
